  intro: "Ever wished your Arduino could act like a tiny security guard who never blinks? Meet the PIR sensor—a clever little gadget that detects motion faster than your cat spots a snack. In this DIY electronics experiment, you’ll learn how to interface an Arduino with a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to create your very own motion detection system. Whether you’re a curious kid or a seasoned tinkerer, this project will show you how a humble sensor can transform ordinary circuits into smart guardians. From spotting sneaky intruders to automating lights, this tutorial makes motion sensing both fun and surprisingly easy. Ready to give your Arduino a sixth sense? Let’s get moving!.",

  intro: "Welcome to the captivating realm of DIY electronics, where even your desk lamp may feel envious! This experiment, “How to Interface RGB LED with Arduino: A Step-by-Step Guide,” demonstrates the process of making a single LED illuminate in a vibrant manner.
